# DASP

## Exercise Session 1

Main entrance is `SOE.m` and `sweetspot.m`. **Remember to re-run `mySA_GUI` and load `GUI_setups/1_4.mat` after running `sweetspot` because sweetspot detection will change the `Computed_RIRs.mat` into an undesirable setup!!!**

## Exercise Session 2

Main entrance is `OLA_test.m` and `WOLA_test.m`.
